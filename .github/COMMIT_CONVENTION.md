# Git Commit Message Convention

> This is adapted from [Angular's commit convention](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular).

Messages must be matched by the following regex:

``` js
/^(revert: )?(feat|fix|polish|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|workflow|ci|chore|types)(\(.+\))?: .{1,50}/
```

## Examples

Coming soon.
